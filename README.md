## Hi there üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

#### My name is **_Jason Porta_** and I am a structural biologist focused on computational cryo-electron microscopy (CryoEM). In the past I have worked on determining the 3D structures of biological macromolecules and also have done a lot of service work in providing computational support, which is my niche area of expertise.

#### For about 15 years I have worked at the interface of scientists and IT professional and **_I am now transitioning into an IT related field_**.

#### **Such work includes**:

- **Linux** systems administration
- Training graduate students to use the Linux command line and shell (**Bash**) scripting.
- Writing scripts (**Bash/Python**) for job submission to a high performance computing (**HPC**) cluster (**PBS** and **Slurm**).
- Creating data processing pipelines for general users of the computing cluster.
- Extract, transform and load (**ETL**) raw data from the instrumentation.
- Managing petabytes of raw and processed data and acting as an architect for how that data is stored and later curated.
- Using **Python** and **Bash** to create software to automate the curation and cold storage of processed data.
- Creating documentation in the form of computational user manuals and best practices.
- Troubleshooting software and hardware issues for our Linux workstations.
- Creating visualizations out of raw data and communicating them to a non-technical audience.
- Creating databases (**SQL**) of lab data sets, instrument bookings and invoicing.
