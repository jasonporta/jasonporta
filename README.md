## Hi there 🙋🏻‍♂️

#### My name is **_Jason Porta_** and I am a structural biologist who uses cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) to determine molecular structures. I prefer to spend my time training and assisting users in the Cryo-EM facility, automating data processing workflows, managing big data and troubleshooting both hardware and software issues. 

#### For about 15 years I have worked at the interface of scientists and IT professionals, and it is at this intersection of structural biology and computer science and I am the most content.

#### **Such work includes**:

- **Linux** 
- Training graduate students to use the Linux command line and shell (**Bash**) scripting.
- Writing scripts (**Bash/Python**) for batch job submission  (e.g., **PBS**, **Slurm**). to high performance computing (**HPC**) clusters.
- Creating data processing pipelines for researchers who use the computing cluster.
- Curating and managing petabytes of raw and processed data by use of university and public data repositories.
- Creating documentation for scientific software, best practices manuals and lab protocols.
- Troubleshooting hardware and software problems.
- Processing raw data and creating graphical representations of the results.
- Creating databases (**SQL**) of lab data sets, instrument bookings and invoicing.
